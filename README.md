# GCP Dataform Demo

A personal exploration into managing BigQuery pipelines with Dataform. I've set up a pipeline for bikeshare data in my GCP project, transforming it through stages to create organized tables in my data mart.

## Highlights

- Using SQLX files to help manage and configure the pipeline.
- Streamline dependencies for optimal performance in data transformations.
- Implement version control for transparent tracking of data transformation changes.
